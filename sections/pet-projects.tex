    Competitive programming tool to use with different judge systems as \href{https://ejudge.ru}{ejudge}, \href{https://codeforces.com}{codeforces}, \href{https://contest.yandex.ru}{yandex-contest}, and so on.
    Inspired by \href{https://github.com/xalanq/cf-tool}{cf-tool}, but keep reusablity for different judge systems in mind.
    % It's my first project in rust, so I tried to use as much benefits for type system as possible.
